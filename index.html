<h2>Fireworks</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Put on a dazzling firework show before time runs out.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Enjoy a speedy game where mouse precision is ismportant.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Time based-clicking game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player can click on fireworks are they shoot into the sky to detonate them. The higher the firework, the more points are gained. If a firework is detonated too low, points are lost. There is a time limit, so the player is to collect as many points as they can before time runs out. Originally, the player would also lose points for letting the fireworks fly by without clicking (but I was not able to figure out how).
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Game mechanics that this prototype used are mouse click input, event looping, spritesheet animations, and a timer.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Fireworks are constantly spawned and have different velocities, making it more difficult to click all the fireworks.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The player is Pyrotechnicians(or someone who works with fireworks) and their goal is to put on the best firework show before the night ends.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The player has inherited the firework buisness from their parents and strive to create the best firework show for the town to see.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Typically children around 4 years old.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
PLay time is around 1 minute.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Clicking on fireworks that are higher in the sky will result in a higher score in comparison to clicking on fireworks in the middle or low areas in the sky. Mouse precision and speed can also help in the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
The buildings foreground image is taken from open source website.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Phaser Examples used for reference: Basic Looped Event, Basic Repeat Event, Body Click
